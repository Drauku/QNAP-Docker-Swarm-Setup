# QNAP Docker Swarm Setup

  A guide for configuring the docker swarm stack on QNAP devices with Container Station

---------------------------------------

## 1. Preparation

- **Ports 80, 443, and 8080 *must be _unused_ by your NAS.*** 
  - By default, QTS assigns ports 8080 and 443 as the default HTTP and HTTPS ports for the QNAP Web Admin Console, and assigns 80 as the default HTTP port for the native "Web Server" application. Each of these must be modified to proceed with this guide.
- Modify these ports as follows to ensure there will be no port conflicts with docker stacks:
  - **Change default System ports:** In QNAP GUI > General Settings, change the default HTTP port to `8880`, and the default HTTPS port to `8443`. 
  - **Change default Web Application ports:** In QNAP GUI > General Settings > Applications > Web Server, change the default HTTP port to `9880`, and the default HTTPS port to `9443`.
  - Unless currently in use, consider disabling both the Web Server and MySQL applications in the QNAP GUI Settings.
- **Ports 80 and 443 must be forwarded from your router to your NAS**. This is *possible* using UPNP in the QNAP GUI, but ***is not recommended!***
  - **Instead, disable UPNP at the router and manually forward ports 80 and 443 to your NAS.**

**In sum:**
- QTS System ports should be:
  - HTTP : 8880
  - HTTPS: 8443

- QTS Web Server application ports should be:
  - HTTP : 9880
  - HTTPS: 9443

---------------------------------------

## 2. Container Station Steps

1. Backup what you have running now (if you don't have anything running yet, skip to Step 3 or 5)

2. Shutdown and remove all Containers:
  - Open SSH terminal to your NAS and run: 
    `docker system prune`
  - To ensure the network topography is reset, run:
    `docker network prune`
  - To be sure you don't have a swarm left hanging around, run:
    `docker swarm leave --force`

3. Remove Container Station:
   - In App Center, click the dropdown for Container Station and choose `Remove`
   - In Control Panel >> Shared Folders, check the box next to the `Container` shared folder and click "Remove"  ([IMAGE](https://i.imgur.com/s1jXNNs.png))
      - In the pop-up box, check "Also delete the data" and click "Yes" ([IMAGE](https://i.imgur.com/WXML3fl.png))

4. Reboot NAS ([IMAGE](https://i.imgur.com/voFkAt9.png))

5. Install Container Station, then launch once installed. 
  - Accept and create the `/Container` folder suggested when CS is launched for the first time.

6. Create a new user called _dockeruser_ 

7. Create the following folder shares *using the QTS web-GUI* at `ControlPanel >> Privilege >> Shared Folders` and give _dockeruser_ Read/Write permissions:
  - `/share/swarm/appdata`
    - Here we will add folders named < stack name >. This is where your application files live... libraries, artifacts, internal application configuration, etc. Think of this directory much like a combination of `C:/Windows/Program Files` and `C:\Users\<UserName>\AppData` in Windows.
  - `/share/swarm/config`
    - Here we will also add folders named < stack name >. Inside this structure, we will keep our actual _stack_name.yml_ files and any other necessary config files used to configure the docker stacks and images we want to run. This folder makes an excellent GitHub repository for this reason.
  - `/share/swarm/runtime`
    - This is a shared folder on a volume that does not get backed up. It is where living DB files and transcode files reside, so it would appreciate running on the fastest storage group you have or in cache mode or in Qtier (if you use it). Think of this like the `C:\Temp\` in Windows.
  - `/share/swarm/secrets`
    - This folder contains secret (sensitive) configuration data that should _NOT_ be shared publicly. This could be stored in a _PRIVATE_ Git repository, but should never be publicized or made available to anyone you don't implicitly trust with passwords, auth tokens, etc.

8. Install the `entware-std` package from the third-party QNAP Club repository. This is necessary in order to setup the shortcuts/aliases in Steps 18 & 19 by editing a permanent profile.
  - The preferred way to do this is to add the QNAP Club Repository to the App Center. Follow the [walkthrough instructions here](https://www.qnapclub.eu/en/howto/1). Note that I use the English translation of the QNAP Club website, but you may change languages (and urls) in the upper right language dropdown.
  - If you don't need the walkthrough, add the repository. (For English, go to App Center, Settings, App Repository, Add, `https://www.qnapclub.eu/en/repo.xml`).
  - If you have trouble locating the correct package below, the correct description begins `entware-3x and entware-ng merged to become entware.` The working link (as of publication) is here: https://www.qnapclub.eu/en/qpkg/556. 
    - If you **cannot** add the QNAP Club store to the App Center, you may manually download the qpkg file from that link and use it to manually install via the App Center, "Install Manually" button. This is **not preferred** as QNAP cannot check for and notify you of updates to the package.
  - Search for `entware-std` and install that package.

  - **Important:** *DO NOT* CHOOSE either the `entware-ng` or `entware-3x-std` packages. These have merged and been superceded by `entware-std`.

---------------------------------------

## 3. QNAP CLI Steps

1. Open/Connect an SSH Terminal session to your QNAP NAS. 
    * You can use [PuTTY](https://putty.org/) 
    * I prefer to use [BitVise](https://www.bitvise.com/ssh-client-download) because this also has an SFTP remove file browser interface.

2. **TYPE:** `id dockeruser` in terminal and note the 'uid' and 'gid'

3. **TYPE:** `docker network ls` The networks shown should match the following (except the generated NETWORK ID):

```
[~] # docker network ls
NETWORK ID          NAME                DRIVER              SCOPE
XXXXXXXXXXXX        bridge              bridge              local
XXXXXXXXXXXX        host                host                local
XXXXXXXXXXXX        none                null                local
```

4. Run: `docker swarm init --advertise-addr <YOUR NAS IP HERE>` - Use ***YOUR*** nas internal LAN IP address

5. **CHECKPOINT:** Run `docker network ls`. Does the list of networks contain one named `docker_gwbridge`?
    * The networks should match the following (except the generated NETWORK ID):

```
[~] # docker network ls
NETWORK ID          NAME                   DRIVER              SCOPE
XXXXXXXXXXXX        bridge                 bridge              local
XXXXXXXXXXXX        docker_gwbridge        bridge              local
XXXXXXXXXXXX        host                   host                local
XXXXXXXXXXXX        ingress                overlay             swarm
XXXXXXXXXXXX        none                   null                local
```

  **Important: If your configuration is lacking a docker_gwbridge or differs from this list**, please contact someone on the [QNAP Unofficial Discord](https://discord.gg/rnxUPMd) (ideally in the [#docker-stack channel](https://discord.gg/MzTNQkV)). Do not proceed beyond this point unless your configuration matches the one above, unless you embrace pain and failure and love very complicated problems that could be QNAP's fault.

6. Create the docker network overlay:
    - **TYPE:** `docker network create --driver=overlay --subnet=172.1.1.0/22 --attachable traefik_public`

7. Create the Traefik specific folders:
    - **TYPE:** `mkdir -p /share/swarm/appdata/traefik`
    - **TYPE:** `mkdir -p /share/swarm/configs/traefik`
    - **TYPE:** `mkdir -p /share/swarm/runtime/traefik`

8. Install nano or vi, whichever you are more comfortable with (only one needed)
    - **RUN:** `opkg install nano`
    - **RUN:** `opkg install vim`
    - ***NOTE:*** You must have installed the `entware-std` package as detailed above in Section-2 Step-8 to be able to use the "opkg" installer.

9. **TYPE:** `nano /opt/etc/profile` (or `vi /opt/etc/profile` if that is your thing)
    ***NOTE:*** If you use a Windows client to save the profile (or the scripts below), they will be saved with CR LF and will error.  
  Please set the file format to UNIX (LF) in order for the profile and scripts to work correctly.
  - Add the following lines to the end of the file and save:

```
# docker_compose_dn -- stops the entered container
dcd(){
  bash /share/swarm/scripts/docker_compose_dn.sh "$1" 
}
# docker_compose_up -- starts the entered container using preconfigured docker_compose files

}

# docker_system_prune -- prunes the docker system (removes unused images and containers)
dprn(){
  bash /share/swarm/scripts/docker_system_prune.sh 
}

# docker_swarm_setup -- creates a new swarm and overlay network, then starts all declared stacks if desired
dwup(){
  bash /share/swarm/scripts/docker_swarm_setup.sh "$1"

---------------------------------------

## 4. Traefik Setup Steps

1. Add the three provided traefik files from the git repository folder "/config/traefik/" to `/share/swarm/configs/traefik` 
    - `application.yaml`, `traefik-static.yaml`, `traefik.yml`
2. **EDIT:** _traefik.yml_ and put your cloudflare email and GLOBAL API KEY in lines 7 & 8 
    **NOTE:** If you are not using cloudflare you will need to check with the Traefik documentation to add the correct environment settings to your _traefik.yml_ file.

3. **EDIT:** _application.yaml_ and _traefik.yml_ to include your domain name.

4. In an SSH Terminal with your QNAP, run the below commands to set traefik folder/file permissions:
    - **TYPE:** `rm /share/swarm/configs/traefik/acme.json`
    - **TYPE:** `touch /share/swarm/configs/traefik/acme.json`
    - **TYPE:** `chmod 600 /share/swarm/configs/traefik/acme.json`

5. Check that `traefik.<yourdomain.com>` resolves to your WAN IP:
    - **TYPE:** `ping traefik.<yourdomain.com>` 
    - **Press:** `ctrl+c` to stop the ping
    **NOTE:** If you don't get the proper IP during this ping operation, update your DNS settings with your domain provider.

6. **TYPE:** `dsd traefik` to start the traefik container

7. Enjoy Traefik and add more containers.

---------------------------------------

## 5. ForwardAuth Setup Steps

1. Navigate to https://auth0.com 
    - Sign in or register for an account
    - Note the Tenant Domain provided by Auth0

2. Navigate to https://github.com 
    - Sign in or register an account using OAuth

    - Go to _Settings -> Developer Settings - OAuth Apps_
        - Create a new app (call it something to recognize it is linked to Auth0)
        - Add homepage URL as `https://<yourauth0accounthere>.auth0.com/`
        - Add authorization callback URL as `https://<yourauth0accounthere>.auth0.com/login/callback`
        - Click "Register appliction" button
        - Note the "Client ID" and "Client Secret"

3. Navigate back to Auth0
    - Go to _Connections -> Social_
        - CLICK the _Github_ slider
            - Enter your GitHub app "ClientID" and "Client Secret" from the previous step
        **NOTE:** Ensure the Attribute _"Email Address"_ is ticked
        - Click the "Save" button
        **NOTE:** Make sure the gray/green slider for _GitHub_ is "green"

    - Go to _Applications_
        - Click on the "Create Application" button
        - Name the new app something recognizable
        - Select the "Regular Web Applications" box
        - Click the "Create" button
        - Once the app is created, click on the "Settings" tab
            - Use the Auth0 "Client ID" and "Client Secret" in your _application.yaml_ file
            **NOTE:** Enter these in Lines 22 & 23, replacing the < redacted > tag
            - Ensure "Token Endpoint Authentication Method" drop down box shows as "Post"
            - Enter in your Callback URL(s), for example:
            ```
            https://<service>.<domain>/signin,
            https://<service>.<domain>/oauth/signin
            ```
        - In the "Allowed Web Origins" field, enter your origin URL:
            `https://<your URL here>`
        - Click the "Save changes" button

    - Go to _Users & Roles -> Users_
        - Create a user with a real email address and password
        **NOTE:** _You will use this later so remember it!_

        - Under the _Access Control_ section, select the _Whitelist_ type 
        - Enter in your email address into the whitelist field on Line 8:
        `const whitelist = [ 'your email here', '2nd email here' ]; //authorized users`

4. Open an SSH Terminal to your QNAP
    - **TYPE:** `dsr traefik` to remove the Traefik stack
        - Wait 10 seconds
    - **TYPE:** `dsd traefik` to deploy the Traefik stack
        - Wait 30 seconds
    - Launch `https://traefik.<yourdomainhere>`
    - Enter Auth0 authentication login to reach traefik dashboard

---------------------------------------

## 6. Docker Script Variables Setup
These variable/config files need to be filled in with your information in order to allow the below scripts to properly function.

  * **NOTE:** `docker_swarm_setup.sh` requires your NAS IP to function, which is entered in the `/share/swarm/conrfigs/swarm_vars.conf` file.
  * **NOTE:** `docker_stack_deploy.sh` uses the pre-defined stack lists in the `/share/swarm/configs/swarm_stacks.conf` file.
      * If you do not edit these stack lists, nothing blows up, no bunnies die, just a big pile of nothingness in your swarm.
  
  * **IMPORTANT!!** Please ensure you save these files in UNIX (LF) format.  Windows (CR LF) format _will_ break these scripts.
      * If you are a Windows user, please download the files from the scripts folder above, or be certain your text editor can properly save UNIX (LF) formatted text files.

##### swarm_stacks.conf
  * This is the list of _all_ stacks you might deploy in your swarm
      * Add a stack name here each time you add a new stack 
```
# List desired services inside the 'stacks' array parentheses (each service name separated by at least a space)
## Each listed stack will require a corresponding '/stackname/stackname.yml' folder/file in the 'configs' folder defined below
## NOTE: Leave Traefik off the list as it will be started seperately
stacks_default=(
  graylog
  portainer
  ddclient
  docker-cleanup
  ouroboros
  nextcloud
  privatebin
  )
stacks_listed=(
  calibre
  calibre
  wetty
  traefik
  TRAEFIK
  TrAeFiK
  )
stacks_all=(
  autopirate
  bitwarden
  bookstack
  calibre
  ddclient
  diskover
  docker-cleanup
  dozzle
  filebrowser
  ghost
  gollum
  graylog
  nextcloud
  ouroboros
  plex
  portainer
  privatebin
  syncthing
  wetty
  )

```

##### swarm_vars.conf
  * These variables are used in the scripts found in `/share/swarm/scripts/`
      * the `stacks_default` array only lists your 'core' stacks, do not include all stack names
```
# Variables list for Drauku's modified QNAP Docker Swarm stack scripts.
# These variables must be filled in with your network, architecture, etc.

# Folder paths for Drauku's folder structure, modified from gkoerk's famously awesome folder structure for stacks
swarm_folder=/share/swarm
appdata_folder=${swarm_folder}/appdata
configs_folder=${swarm_folder}/configs
runtime_folder=${swarm_folder}/runtime
secrets_folder=${swarm_folder}/secrets
scripts_folder=${swarm_folder}/scripts
stacks_folder=${swarm_folder}/stacks

# These variables are required to properly assign user:group to newly created folders
var_user=1000
var_group=100

# Internal network NAS IP address
var_nas_ip=192.168.186.150

#

```
---------------------------------------

## 7. Scripts Setup
Please create these scripts and save them to `/share/swarm/scripts` if you want to use the cli shortcuts we created in earlier steps.


All the stack scripts (`xxx_stack.sh`) require you to edit the stacks list to match your setup.  If you do not edit them they will fail to deploy the stacks you did not list... 

**NOTE:** 

##### docker_compose_dn (dcd)
  * stops the entered container
```
#!/bin/bash
# This script STOPS (bring 'down') a single Docker container using a pre-written compose file.

# Load config variables from file

# Perform scripted action(s)
docker-compose -f ${configs_folder}/"$1"/"$1".yml down
```

##### docker_compose_up (dcu)
  * starts the entered container using preconfigured docker_compose files
```
#!/bin/bash
# This script STARTS (bring 'up') a single Docker container using a pre-written compose file.

# Load config variables from file
